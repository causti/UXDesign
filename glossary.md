* **Iterative Design**: A methodology based on a cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analysing, and refining a product or process. Based on the results of testing the most recent iteration of a design, changes are made. This process is intended to ultimately improve the quality and functionality of a design.

### J
* [**Jakob Nielsen**](http://www.nngroup.com/people/jakob-nielsen/): Jakob Nielsen, Ph.D., is a User Advocate and principal of the Nielsen Norman Group which he co-founded with Dr. Donald A. Norman (former VP of research at Apple Computer). Dr. Nielsen established the "discount usability engineering" movement for fast and cheap improvements of user interfaces and has invented several usability methods, including heuristic evaluation. He holds 79 United States patents, mainly on ways of making the Internet easier to use.

### K
### L
* **Lean UX**: Inspired by Lean and Agile development theories, Lean UX speeds up the UX process by putting less emphasis on deliverables and greater focus on the actual experience being designed.

* **Low-Fidelity Prototype**: A quick and easy translation of high-level design concepts into tangible and testable artifacts, giving an indication of the direction that the product is heading.

### M
* [**Mental Models**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model): An explanation of someone's thought process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person's intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences.

* [**Mockup**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockup): A mockup is the followup step after a wireframe. It includes the actual design and therefore represents the final user interface. Mockups can either be static images, or simulate functionality to different degrees. Mockups can be used to test the user interface at low development costs.

* **Mood Board**: A collage, either physical or digital, which is intended to communicate the visual style a direction is heading.

### N
### O
### P
* **Paper Prototype**: A rough, often hand-sketched, drawing of a user interface, used in a usability test to gather feedback. Participants point to locations on the page that they would click, and screens are manually presented to the user based on the interactions they indicate.

* [**Personas**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_%28user_experience%29): Concrete descriptions of possible users. A persona usually includes basic demographics, a picture, and any information that help bring the fictive person to life. This can be characteristics to describe the personality, but also goals, preferences, and limitations that can be directly linked to the product or system under development. Through a variety of different personas, a target group becomes more concrete. Especially in the beginning of a design process, personas help to pin down specific user requirements.

* **Production Stage**: The stage at which the high-fidelity design is fleshed out, content and digital assets are created, and a high-fidelity version of the product is validated with stakeholders and end-users through user testing sessions. The role of the UX Designer shifts from creating and validating ideas to collaborating with developers to guide and champion the vision.

* [**Progressive Disclosure**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disclosure): An interaction design technique often used in human computer interaction to help maintain the focus of a user's attention by reducing clutter, confusion, and cognitive workload. This improves usability by presenting only the minimum data required for the task at hand.

* **Project Kick-Off**: The formally recognized start of a project.

* [**Prototype**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype): A prototype is a provisional version of a product or system that is used  to visualizes ideas and test functionalities. Prototypes are used in  all different fields and in different stages of the development of a  product. The idea behind prototyping is to validate ideas and concepts  early in the development process in order to save time and money.  Changes in prototypes can be made quite easily compared with changes in  fully functional products.

### Q
* **Questionnaires**: A research instrument consisting of a series of questions and other prompts for the purpose of gathering information from respondents.

### R
* [**Red Routes**](http://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/redroutes.html): The frequent and critical activities that users will perform on your site. They are complete activities, not single tasks, and will probably require several pages to execute. Defining the red routes for your site means that you'll be able to identify and eliminate any usability obstacles on the key user journeys. (Important roads in London are known as 'red routes' and Transport for London do everything in their power to make sure passenger journeys on these routes are completed as smoothly and quickly as possible.)

* **Research Stage**: Often referred to as the Discovery stage. Complex projects will comprise significant user and competitor research activities, while small projects may require nothing more than some informal interviews and a survey.

* **Responsive Design**: A design approach that responds to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries.

### S
* **Scenario**: A scenario is a narrative of how a persona interacts with a product or system to  reach certain goals. Scenarios show how different personas use a  product or system differently. Especially in early stages of the design  process, scenarios help to identify user requirements and understand how  users approach a task. Scenarios consider users’ personalities, their  interests, abilities, and limitations, but also environmental aspects,  that influence the interaction with a product or system.

* **Selection Bias**: Selection bias occurs in usability studies when your selected test participants either don’t represent your target group, or when they are not selected randomly. Examples of non random samples can be an imbalance in aspects like gender, expertise, or geographical location, or only people, who are already extremely enthusiastic about product, agree to participate in your study. A selection bias can influenced and possibly falsify your test results.

* **Service Design**: The practice of designing a product according to the needs of users, so that the service is user-friendly, competitive and relevant to the users.

* **Sitemap**: A complete list of all the pages available on a website.

* [**Skeuomorphism**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph): A skeuomorph is a derivative object that retains ornamental design cues from structures that were necessary in the original. Examples include pottery embellished with imitation rivets reminiscent of similar pots made of metal and a software calendar that imitates the appearance of binding on a paper desk calendar.

* [**Software Design Pattern**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_%28computer_science%29): In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

* **Strategy Stage**: The stage during which the brand, guiding principles, and long-term vision of an organization are articulated. The strategy underpinning a UX project will shape the goals of the project---what the organization is hoping to achieve with the project, how its success should be measured, and what priority it should have in the grand scheme of things.

* **Storyboard**: A tool inspired by the film making industry, where a visual sequence of events is used to capture a user’s interactions with a product. Depending on the audience, it may be an extremely rough sketch, purely for crystallizing your own ideas.

* **Survey**: An online form designed to solicit feedback from current or potential users.

* **Stakeholder Interviews**: Conversations with the key contacts in the client organization funding, selling, or driving the product.

### T
* **Target Group**: A target group describes a certain group of people for whom a system or  product is intended. The target group consists of future users who  define the requirements for a product or system. A target group can be  very specific and defined, or very broad. The more specific the target  group, the more specific the product requirements that can be  identified.

* **Technical Communication**: The practice of creating easily accessible information for a specific audience.

* **Think-Aloud Protocol**: Think-aloud protocol is a research technique that is mainly used for user testing. Test participants are asked to verbalize their thoughts, actions and feelings while interacting with a test interface. This way, test moderators can get detailed information about what participants expect, why they perform certain actions, or what bothers them

### U
* [**Unified Modeling Language(UML)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_diagram#Interaction_diagrams): A general-purpose modeling language in the field of software engineering. The basic level provides a set of graphic notation techniques to create visual models of object-oriented software-intensive systems. Higher levels cover process-oriented views of a system.

* **Usability**: According to the International Standards Organization (ISO 9241),  Usability is the extent to which a product can be used by specified  users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and  satisfaction in a specified context of use. Now this is a very official  sounding definition. In other words, good usability implies that users  can easily use a product and by doing so, reach their goals quickly and  without falling into despair. Some aspects of usability overlap with the  user experience of a system. Good usability should also include a good  user experience.

* **Usability Engineering**: The practice of assessing and making recommendations to improve the usability of a product.

* **Usability Lab**: A usability lab is a laboratory set up for usability testing. Usually, a usability lab consists of a test and an observation room. The two rooms are either divided through a one-way mirror, or cameras are installed, so people in the observation room can follow the test. The test room is at least equipped with a microphone and a camera that record how the test person interacts with a system. Usability labs can also be equipped with more advanced material such as an eye-tracker.

* [**Usability Testing**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing): A technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate a product by testing it on users. This can be seen as an irreplaceable usability practice, since it gives direct input on how real users use the system.

* **Use Cas**e: A use case describes a very specific interaction between user and  system. It usually includes one or more tasks that a user engages in to  reach a certain goal. With use cases, common tasks are identified and  functionality, usability, and the UX of a system can be tested.

* **User-Centered Design(UCD)**: A design process during which the needs of the user is considered at all times. Designers consider how a user is likely to use the product, and they then test the validity of their assumptions in real world tests with actual users.

* [**User Experience(UX)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience): Involves a person's behaviors, attitudes, and emotions about using a particular product, system or service. User experience includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human-computer interaction and product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person’s perceptions of system aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency. User experience may be considered subjective in nature to the degree that it is about individual perception and thought with respect to the system. User experience is dynamic as it is constantly modified over time due to changing usage circumstances and changes to individual systems as well as the wider usage context in which they can be found.

* **User Feedback Loop**: Ideas are put in front of users, who provide their feedback, which is used to refine the design, and then the process repeats.

* **User Journey**: The step by step journey that a user takes to reach their goal.

* **User Interview**: Used for understanding the tasks and motivations of the user group for whom you are designing, user interviews may be formally scheduled, or just informal chats.

* **User Research**: Observation techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methodologies which are used to focus on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations.

* **User Test**: A user sits in front of your website or app and you have them perform tasks and think out loud while doing so.

* **UXPin**: A collaborative app that includes stencils for creating wireframes and low fidelity prototypes.&nbsp;

### V
* **Visual Design**: Also called communication design. A discipline which combines design and information development in order to develop and communicate a media message to a target audience.

### W
* **Waterfall Model**: A sequential design process where progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards through the phases of Conception > Initiation > Analysis > Design > Construction > Testing > Implementation > Maintenance.

* [**Wireframe**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe): A rough guide for the layout of a website or app, either done with pen and paper or with wireframing software.

* **Workflow Diagram**: A graphical representation of activities and actions conducted by users of a system. (Sometimes called an activity diagram.)
